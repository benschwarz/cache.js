# cache.js
HTML5 localStorage with timed expiry

## Why?

For ajax or heavy computational stuff that could probably be done once a minute, rather than every time the functions/events are called.

## Browser support

Anything that supports localStorage. You could use a [localStorage polyfill](https://gist.github.com/350433) to use it with older browsers.

For brevity, the browsers that support localStorage are Firefox 3.5, Safari 4, IE8, Chrome 4+

## Usage

Add `cache.js` to your HTML, I've included a closure compressed `cache.min.js` for use online.


When you're in the middle of doing some heavy ajax, you can store the response in cache.

    Cache.set('a unique identifier', {foo: 'bar'});

Your key of 'a unique identifier' can now be returned using the `get` method.

    Cache.get('a unique identifier');

    => {foo: 'bar'}

It will only be available for 10000ms (the default)

### Getting a non existant key

    Cache.get('will be null');
    => null


Of course, you can set the expiry on a per key basis

    Cache.set('key', 'value', 5e4); // 50,000 Milliseconds

Or set a global expiry to be used for all caches

    Cache.expiry = 5e4 // 50K ms

Pulling it all together, you might do something like this:

    var cache = Cache.get("/url");
    if(cache) return cache;

    $.get("/url", function (response) {
      Cache.set("/url", response);
      // Do something awesome with your responseText
    });

### Optional 'get' function if value is null

Often, you'll want to do something if the value is not cached. Pass a function to the `get` function:

    var result = Cache.get('empty key', function(key) {
      return 'bacon';
    });
    // `result` is now 'bacon' since there was no stored value.

For example, you could execute an Ajax call if the local storage is empty. Here's the earlier example with a cleaner style:

    return Cache.get("/url", function(key) {
      return $.get(key, function (response) {
        Cache.set(key, response);
        return response;
      });
    });

## Bugs / Contributions [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/benschwarz/cache.js.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/benschwarz/cache.js)

* [Report a bug](http://github.com/benschwarz/cache.js/issues)
* To contribute, or send an idea wither github message me or fork the project.
* If you're changing functionality, please perouse the `test/` directory first.
* You can run the tests on a Mac by running `rake test`, otherwise, just open suite.html in a browser

## Build

If you're on a mac, run `rake build`â€”You'll need the google closure compiler installed, but it will package `cache.js` into `cache.min.js`. Then it'll automagically make a commit describing what you've done. Magic.
